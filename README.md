# Diff-IP2D

This is the official implementation for our paper: **Diff-IP2D: Diffusion-Based Hand-Object Interaction Prediction on Egocentric Videos**.

Diff-IP2D is the first work to jointly forecast future hand trajectories and object affordances by the devised denoising diffusion probabilistic model with only 2D egocentric videos as input. It provides a foundation generative paradigm in the field of HOI prediction.

We will release the code and relevant data upon the acceptance of our paper.
